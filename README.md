###
<p align="left">The Multi-Commodity Transportation Problem Solver with Kivy UI is designed to solve Multi-commodity transportation problems given the following values: number of Supply Centers, number of Demand Centers, number of Types of Goods,
Supply Center's Limits for each Types of Goods, Demand Center's demans for each Types of Goods and the Transportation Cost of each Type of Good from each Supply Center to each
Demand Center, these information should be given to the app in the following format:
  The first three values are basicly intergers that represent the number of each Supply Center, Demand Center and Types of Goods.
  For the last three values the first one is the Supply Center's Limits for each Type of Goods which is given in multiple lists each in which we include the limit for goods index wise
  and each list represent a Supply Center, the goods' limits should be separetaed with "," (comma) and the lists (Which represent Supply Centers) should be separated with ";" (semicolon).
  for the Demand Limits the values should be added like the Supply Limits but the only defferance is that each list represent a Demand Center.
  The last values that should be added are Transportation Costs, which should be added in the following format: these values are nestes lists which the numbers represent the Transportation
  Cost of each Type of Good form each Demand Center index wise (the index of the numbers represent the costs and the index of the nested list (which itself is inside another list) represent the Demand Center
  which is added in here we separate the Demand Centers (lists that represent them) with ":" (colon) and for the Supply Centers we separate them with ";" (semicolon).
There is a button defined in the app that imports an example for better understand how you should enter your values, in which there are 2 Supply Centers, 2 Demand Centers and 2 Types of Goods
lets explain one instance of each imported values:<p/>

* for example 10 inside "10, 15; 20, 5" means that the Supply Center number one has a limit of 10 for the good number 1 and also 5 means that the Supply Center number 2 has limit of 5 for good number 2.
* 10 (first) inside "15, 10; 15, 10" means that the Demand Center number one demands 10 of good type 2, and so on.
* 4 (first) inside "2,3:3,2; 4,1:1,4" means that the cost of transporting Good Type 1 from Supply Center number 2 to Demand Center number 1 is $4, and so on.
